First Ionic 2 App

## IonicFirebaseAuth

This app can be used for Android or iOS, it implements Firebase and its wrapper (AngularFire2) to be able to connect to firebase and its authentication feature.

Right now it only works with Facebook Authentication, but can be implemented to use Email/Twitter/Google/etc...

Also, you need to use your own Firebase API-KEY that can be found when creating an app in Firebase Console.
